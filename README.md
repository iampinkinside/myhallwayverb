Overall this is a big work in progress, I just recently got into C++ development and I plan to update this plugin as I learn new things.

For now the impulse responses are low quality recordings (done using macbook's mics) but I'll update them soon... tho, to be fair the current ones have a character of their own so maybe I'll do something with them as well.

The UI is very basic so far, I'll make it a bit more pretty and also add some labels etc.

But in essence this is a plugin that's made for adding the unique sound of MY hallway to your mixes...

Do with it what you want... beside selling it maybe?
