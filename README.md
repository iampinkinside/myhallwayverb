For now the impulse responses are low quality recordings (done using macbook's mics) but I'll update them soon...
Tho, to be fair the current ones have a character of their own so maybe I'll do something with them as well.

The UI is very basic so far, I'll make it a bit more pretty and also add some labels etc.

But in essence this is a plugin that's made for adding the unique sound of MY hallway to your mixes...
Do with it what you want..., beside selling it maybe?
